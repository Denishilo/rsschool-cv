## About myself:
My goal is to move forward, it so happened that working as a civil engineer over past couples of years has led me to a dead end. The psychological crisis, professional crisis and financial crisis prompted me to study something new and and progressive.There hasn't been a day in the last few months for me to forget about my new goal - to be a programmer. Even now, late evening, after repairing the apartment and spending time with my family, I sit and study. My environment says that I'm punctual and tactful, diligent and scrupulous, prudent and easily find contact with people.
